# Tailwind CSS Classes Missing After Production Build

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where styles are not applied after the production build process. The build process completes successfully without errors, but the styles are missing from the final output. This only happens in production; development mode works fine.

## Bug Description

The issue stems from a build process problem. Tailwind CSS correctly processes and generates the stylesheets. However, the integration with the application's bundling and asset pipeline fails in the production build, leading to missing styles in the final application.  The development server works correctly, highlighting the problem is isolated to the production build and not a Tailwind configuration error. 

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the production version of the app.  Observe missing styles.
4. Run `npm run dev` to run the development server; note the correct styles being applied.

## Solution

The solution involves investigating the build process and how it integrates with Tailwind CSS.  The issue may be related to improper asset handling, incorrect file paths, or conflicts within build configuration files (Webpack, Rollup, etc.). The solution file contains a corrected webpack configuration to solve the issue.
